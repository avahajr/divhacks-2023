            Our mission at Tailor Trade is to combat the ongoing environmental
            damage being perpetuated by clothing waste and the fast fashion
            industry. We also aim to create an accessible fashion-oriented
            marketplace that seeks to eliminate any cost from the process â€” this
            means no delivery fees, no-cost registration, and no transportation
            fees.
